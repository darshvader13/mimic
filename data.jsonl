As a part of the monastic society, Buddhist monks have to follow the rules of the Vinaya scripture, with one of these rules saying that monks can only obtain food from the good deeds and wholesome acts of laymen. This rule connects these monks to society, which would be very beneficial to their quest on reaching enlightenment or nirvana as experiences with other people are essential to realizing the human condition.  Siddharta Gautama was able to witness first-hand the suffering or dukhka that people experience, whether it be old-age, illness, or etc, which guided him to reaching nirvana and discovering the truth or dharma. Although these monks do not contribute much labor-wise or economically to society, by following the rules of the Vinaya, a monk can \u201cfulfill their obligation to society and render himself a merit for the laity\u201d (The Buddhist Community 77). Monks can help the collective effort by being an auspicious symbol and giving blessings to laymen during significant days or important rituals, such as marriages or funerals. Also, the Vinaya scripture has these many rules regarding the lifestyle of monks because of the fact that detachment is a key necessity to reach nirvana.  This idea of detachment from human pleasures can be seen in many of the rules of the Vinaya, such as refraining from sexual misconduct and harming other living beings. For example, the begging of food is symbolic of the fact that these monks renounced their position in society for the pursuit of nirvana. By not being able to support themselves, these monks become very modest and are able to experience detachment from worldly desires, whether it be money, position in society, or delicious food. Because of the own lack of support, these monks are able to detach from reality and achieve nirvana."}]}

Another signature of the UNSUB is that they also collect trophies of their victims. Sometimes, these trophies are pictures of the victims and other times, trophies like the wedding rings might be taken off the victims before they commit anything sexual to symbolize pureness or the wedding rings might be taken off as a sexual \u201cprize\u201d. The UNSUB probably gains sexual pleasure and release from the killings. This implies that the UNSUB is most likely sexually incompetent and thus, killed and sexually assaulted the victims to feel like they have a sense of power and authority in their sex life. Most likely, the victims do not know the UNSUB at all due to the different the victims are age, location, and race wise. The UNSUB probably lives in the area of the killings and the victims probably caught the UNSUB\u2019s eye as attractive. Given their diverse, but still youngish ages, the victims probably do not remind the UNSUB of anyone particular in their lives. Rather, the UNSUB probably only chose to attack them because they were sexually attracted to the victims.

The sexual incompetence of the UNSUB probably led them to attempt to achieve power and authority by taking control of their victims, sexually assaulting them, and then killing them. The UNSUB could also be a Hedonist as they took most likely pleasure in assaulting their victims, but I think that they are more likely a Power and Control type of serial killer. Based on the victims ages, I would assume that the UNSUB is a male in their twenties or thirties and saw these similarly-aged victims as sexually attractive and thus exerted himself onto them. The UNSUB is most likely white, but could be any race as they do not show a race preference in their victims. The UNSUB is most likely a lonely sociopath with little to no relationships due to their inability to achieve competence in their sex life. The UNSUB does not seem very confident in themselves and their communication ability as they could only subdue their victims phyiscally. This UNSUB reminds me of Benjamin Barnwright from the show Mindhunter. He also fits the Power and Control type and could also be classified as a sociopath. He was a white male in his twenties when he killed his girlfriend because he felt like he did not much authority in their relationship as she was promiscuous during their relationship.

This total control of power can be seen in the actions of governments and institutions in the nineteenth century, which Michel Foucalt mentions in the second paragraph of Society Must Be Defended. In this lecture, Foucault talks about how the power dynamic between the government and the people has shifted over time, moving from disciplinary power to one more ethical. \n\nHe quotes the phrase \u201csovereign power\u201d as the tyrannical power of governments and institutions and their control over the people\u2019s lives. Foucault says that \u201cthe right of life and death was one of sovereignty\u2019s basic attributes\u201d(240). This power and right of life, or rather, the right to kill or let live, was exercised by many in power in the 1800\u2019s and before. This so-called right can only affect people not when the sovereign chooses to let live, but only when the sovereign chooses to kill, as that is what defines the power. People have the right to choose whether or not they want to live, but only a corrupt, powerful few have the right to end your life. He goes on to say that this lopsided relationship between the people and the sovereign is \u201cparadoxical\u201d because \u201cthe subject is by rights, neither dead, nor alive...the subject is neutral\u201d(240). This contradiction is only possible because of the sovereign\u2019s ability to take life and because of this, only the sovereign can know if someone is alive or dead. This uneven relationship with the sovereign is in large part because of how the sovereign has this God-like judgement to end life, but not the ability to create it. Adding to this contradiction, sovereign power strikes fear in the hearts of the people that handed over their rights to their own lives. This connection between the sovereign and the people who are controlled by them is not an effective way of governing because first, there is no checks and balances in place to restrict the sovereign as this right of life and death is only one sided and two, this way of ruling only attempts to inflict fear and to eliminate the \u201crotten\u201d members of society rather than trying to conform the punished and strengthen the rest of the members of society.\n\nAs countries and civilizations grew and developed, this way of ruling became less and less effective due to the rapid growth and industrialization of society. So, the way of sovereign power gradually turned into quite the reverse, a phrase that Foucault has coined \u201cbiopolitics\u201d. Rather than letting live and make die, biopolitics can be seen as the opposite as it has the power to make live and let die. Rather than ruling out of fear, biopolitics is focused on managing a whole population through data such as birth rates, mortality rates, education rates, etc. This system is built on trying to improve the quality of life of the population as a whole rather than ruling with extreme fear and trying to get rid of the \u201cworst members\u201d of society. However, although they may sound very different, in practice, they do share similarities. In both cases, the ruling authority has the right over life over its constituents, although it may not seem that malicious at first. Like sovereign power, biopolitics has the ability to kill those who they please, but indirectly, as those in power can disproportionally allocate resources and things along that manner, which enables racism and separation in general, which was noted by Foucault later in the lecture. Both of these ways of governing also have God-like power, in that the authorities can choose who dies and who to save and can change the entire course of civilizations, supreme power that only rivals that of deities. \n\nOverall, Foucalt argues that the power dynamic between the constituents and the government has varied over time, starting from sovereign power and moving to biopolitics. Although government has become less focused on disciplinary measures as Foucault noted, it has not stopped them from controlling the lives and deaths of millions and billions of people. This social contract between the people and their governing is immoral and gives these governments immense power over the actions and decisions of its people. By having control over so many of these lives, these governments, as the father of the nuclear bomb, Robert Oppenehimer said, \u201chave become Death, destroyer of worlds\u201d."}]}

One of the main reasons behind this change is the removal of superstition due to the Buddhism reformation movement started by Inoue Enryo. Enryo claimed that \u201creligion teaches the way for our relative essence to enter into the absolute world. In Buddhism, this is namely enlightenment in the turning away from delusion\u201d (159). In this quote, he is saying that by ignoring delusional superstitions that existed in Buddhism back then, one can reach the \u201cabsolute\u201d, the goal of religion. These superstitions include ritual practice such as exorcising curses and belief in the supernatural such as demons, goblins and other devilish creatures. Enryo leads the change from ritual-based Buddhism to a more modern and idealistic form of the religion, one based more on philosophy than practice. Inoue Enryo also uses the concept of shojo nimon, the idea of means of awakening, whether it be achieving nirvana or reaching the Pure Land by reciting nembutsu. Enryo argues that the ritual nature of nembutsu is based on the philosophical values of Mahayana Buddhism and exists to appeal to people who do not yearn for spiritual ideals, and thus works the same to reach enlightenment. This use of shojo nimon by Enryo is used to show that Buddhsim is shifting to religion based more on belief because people partake in both of these rituals because they believe that they can detach from this material world and become enlightened. The acceptance of clerical marriage by the S\u014dt\u014d school also shows the shift of Japanese Buddhism from practice to belief. This major adoption was backed by the idea that anyone should be able to reach enlightenment, whether they are married or not. Because of this ideal, this practice of clergy not marrying diminished in popularity because enlightenment is based on one\u2019s beliefs, spirituality, and connection to this world, not whether or not they are married. In conclusion, Inoue Enryo\u2019s concept of shojo nimon, Enryo\u2019s definition of religion, and the acceptance of clerical marriage led to a shift from practice to belief in Japanese Buddhism."}]}

According to Du Bois, the color line describes the economic and social gap between white people and African Americans and minorities in general in the US. Du Bois claims that emancipation has not completely freed African Americans, as they are still trapped into poverty due to the white upper class exploiting them for cheap labor. Even though African Americans were free, they were not equal to white Americans economically, socially, politically, nor educationally. Du Bois blames this problem on the nature of capitalism and exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie. He claims that \u201cthe workers of the world must have voice not only on conditions of work but also as to what kinds of good shall be produced and what methods of production used\u201d (The World and Africa 161). This is an expansion of Marx\u2019s ideals because he also claims that the bourgeoisie exploit the proletariat (in this case, the upper class of white Americans exploiting African Americans) and that the workers should have a voice in the means of production. This is an update to Marxist belief because Marx believed that the workers should seize control of the means of production and implement communism, which Du Bois has not explicitly stated. Du Bois believed that African Americans had a lack of opportunity in the US because they had no wealth to begin with once they were emancipated and white employers still were very racist long after emancipation. Du Bois also claimed that there was a lack of opportunity for the knowledgeable and literate African Americans because literacy only correlated negatively with violent crimes, meaning literate people had to commit petty crime to survive, since there were not many employment opportunities for them. This fits into Marxist theory because these crimes committed are a result of the below subsistence pay from white exploitation or no pay at all due to lack of opportunities. Overall, the Du Bois analysis of the color line leads to the possibility of a Marxist revolution by the underrepresented and underserved minorities to potentially seize the means of production and be on an equal footing as the majority oppressors. \n\n\n\nQuestion 2:\n\n\n\nDurkheim and Weber had different, but similar perspectives on the function of law in society. Durkheim thought that the laws of society exist to protect the consciousness of the entire society. Durkheim believed that crimes were illegal because they \u201cseem harmful to the society that represses them\u201d (Division of Labor 73) rather than actually being harmful to society. Thus, Durkheim believed that punishment is a way of striking fear into people so they don\u2019t plan on hurting society by committing the crime. Durkheims\u2019s ideals are based on the fact that society has a collective consciousness, and thus all share some values and morals. This type of thought process works in a mechanical society, meaning that societies are independent and do not need to interact with each other to survive and thrive. Since people are closer to each other in a mechanical society, there is a much larger collective consciousness, compared to an organic society, which is a society that depends on other societies to survive, meaning that their work is more specialized. There is a much less effect of the collective conscience in this type of society, and thus there is more individualism. There are more interactions between different types of people in an organic society, and thus, \u201cat the same time that domestic obligations become more numerous, they take on, as is said, a public character\u201d (210). In this society, relationships become under the control of the law, which is different compared to mechanical societies. \n\n\n\nWeber believed that the law should act very rationally, in that it equally applies to everyone in society, with no exceptions. He believed in rationality because it allows society to be more efficient and predictable because situations do not have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but rather, everything works under one rational system. Weber believed that law systems and institutions should be structured as bureaucracies, in which public servants exist to rationally handle the day-to-day matters of the people and work under the voted-in government officials. Weber believed in a formally rational system of law, in which values are treated as distinct to the law, in which laws are based on those set values. \n\nOverall, Weber believes that the law should be based on a set of values, but Weber has a more rational approach to this problem.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3:\n\n\n\n\tMarx and Maine have different thoughts on rights. Marx claims that natural rights are a creation of the bourgeois and belief in them benefits the upper class. He does not believe that legal rights are a pathway to achieving freedom. Marx talks about the political and civil sphere, in that it is possible to achieve freedom in the political sphere with laws that promote voting rights, etc, but it is impossible to achieve freedom in the civil sphere, as it is impossible to stop ideas such as racism from being spread in people\u2019s minds. Political freedom benefits the bourgeois because it gives the illusion of full freedom, when people are actually bound by the limitations of the civil sphere. This allows the bourgeois to take away the proletariat's rights, thus benefiting them greatly. \n\n\n\n\tMaine believes that over time, society has shifted from status-based to contract-based. Thus, he believes that rights shifted from being based on the status of the individual to the contracts of the individual. Maine believes that rights are earned, which contrasts Marx\u2019s perspective of natural rights. They also differ because Marx doesn\u2019t believe that people can achieve true freedom with rights, while Maine believes that people can, they just need to earn it based on their contracts. Overall, Marx and Maine have wildly different views on the topic of rights and their function within the state."}]}

In the article US Says China\u2019s Repression of Uighurs is Genocide, the authors say that former president Trump declares that the atrocities happening to Uighur Muslims in China right now are genocide after \u201cbrushing away the concerns\u201d for years. Since 2014, China has taken part in the Uighur genocide of millions of Uighur Muslims across the country through the use of internment camps, torture, forced sterilization, and many human rights violations. Almost seven years later, the US has become the first country in the entire world to acknowledge this tragedy as a genocide, as defined by the United Nations, is \u201cacts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\u201d, which is very shocking considering the advancement in human rights since the Holocaust. More than 50 years after World War 2, it seems as if history has repeated itself through these genocides, despite the supposed efforts by many countries including the US to prevent this. It is laughable that the so-called greatest countries of the world have just started to acknowledge this devastating genocide. How can countries built on the principles of freedom and democracy refuse to take action when millions of innocent civilians have had their rights stripped from them and are being treated like farm animals? Weeks after the acknowledgment of the genocide, President Biden commented that these atrocities were just a different cultural norm, doubling down on the worldwide efforts to refuse to get involved in China\u2019s blatant violation of human rights. Although many think of America as a free and democratic utopia, based on the government\u2019s lack of action during the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of action dealing with the Uighur genocide, the US is a lot more similar to the oppressive nature of China than many people may think. \n\nThe sovereign authoritarian government of China is described in Foucault\u2019s lecture Society Must Be Defended, in which he says that the sovereign has the right of life and death in that they could \u201ctake life and let live\u201d (8), which can be seen through the government\u2019s efforts in the Uighur genocide. Although Foucault is talking about governments of centuries past, it can be applied to modern-day regimes like China, a country is known for its corrupt and authoritarian government that heavily censors and violates its constituents. By putting these Uighur Muslims in internment camps and stripping them of their humanity, the Chinese government is exercising its sovereign power over their people. They have the \u201cright of the sword\u201d over these interned Uighurs and their people in general in that they have the disproportionate ability to take life away rather than to create life. This function of this supposed right is to improve the well-being of society, and yet, these efforts are very counterproductive, as these internment camps are used for re-education, brainwashing, and mass sterilization to prevent and eliminate the spread of Uighur culture to mainland China. Control of this nature and magnitude over a population has been seen before in history, as pointed out by Foucault: \u201cThere was, in Nazism, a coincidence, between a generalized biopower and a dictatorship that was at once absolute and retransmitted throughout this entire social body by this fantastic extension of the right to kill and the exposure of death\u201d (27). Modern-day countries such as the US can control and manipulate the biological whole of society, but China and Nazi Germany both exert this biopower over their population and sovereign power over their individual constituents. Both of these regimes have God-like control over their populations due to their right of life over the population\u2019s birth rates and the right of death with their ability to take lives. This divine power should not be given to any governing body, especially not to an inhumane, authoritarian, and oppressive government like China. The Nazi state\u2019s use of extreme racism to attempt to better society through the elimination of races and cultures that they deemed inferior ultimately backfired as this genocide caused the destruction and fall of their people and regime. The Uighur genocide can be seen as propaganda used to brainwash the Chinese people that their race, culture, and lifestyle are superior to others and that inferior cultures should be wiped out and replaced. This cruel sovereign power of the Chinese government should not exist as they have too much power in controlling the lives of their constituents.\n\n\tAlthough countries like the US are always put on this pedestal because of the opportunities, democracy, and freedom, they are not that different from authoritarian regimes such as China. Foucault mentions in his lecture Society Must Be Defended that modern governments moved from using sovereign power to using biopower and biopolitics to influence and control their population. He continues by saying that biopolitics is controlling society as a whole through the control of life metrics such as birth rate, life expectancy, mortality rate, and more. While China has a big influence on how individuals act due to their sovereign power, the US has this same influence, but across the general population. This biopower can be seen through the events that took place this year in the Coronavirus. Since the virus spread to America last March, there have been over half a million deaths in the US alone, many of which can be attributed to the government\u2019s lack of response. The biopolitics of the US was incapable of helping the American people during this time of great need due to the disinformation and lack of action by the government. Foucault coins the biopower\u2019s right over life and death \u201cmake live or let die\u201d, differing from the sovereign's ability to \u201clet live or make die\u201d, to describe how biopolitics functions, which can be seen in consequences of the American government\u2019s efforts today. Due to the little action and disinformation, the government has let thousands of Americans die every day, disproportionately affecting the elderly, poor, and minority communities. This inequality can also be seen through the current vaccine distribution in America as these same communities that are most affected by the virus are getting unequally less access to the vaccines compared to more privileged and wealthier people. Foucault speaks on the racism depicted here, saying \u201cIt is primarily a way of introducing a break into the domain of life that is under power\u2019s control; the break between what must live and what must die\u201d (21). Because of the country\u2019s biopolitical system, the US has used segregation and prejudice, in general, to pick and choose who to make survive and who to let die based on age, race, income, etc. A country considered to be the paradise for immigrants around the world is stained with all types of racism and bigotry against those same foreigners, which is apparent in the many recent events of racial hatred. The US recognizing the Uighur tragedy as genocide is ironic as they have established the norm of thousands of innocent Americans dying every day because of the government\u2019s inabilities and choices. \n\nBefore the pandemic, we were able to implicitly use the air without having to worry about masks, large crowds, etc, but now we live in a time where that implicit has become explicit. The atmo-terrorism that Sloterdjik talks about in Terror from the Air is very similar to the Coronavirus because \u201cthe necessity to breathe, becomes at once a victim and an unwilling accomplice in his own annihilation\u201d (Sloterdijk 20-21). This connects to current day events because of how we took for granted breathable air now that the air has become miasma and infected due to the virus. However, due to the partisan disinformation spread during the last year, people have ignored the toxic explicit environment and lived their lives like usual, leading to so many American casualties. America has said that they will take action against China\u2019s genocide of Uighur Muslims, but how can a country that has caused the deaths of over half a million of its people tell another country how to treat its constituents? There will likely be zero action taken by the US government to stop the Uighur genocide because an oppressive regime is in no power and has no reason to tell another oppressive regime what to do. These countries are so similar because both the biopolitics of the US and the sovereign power of China are immoral methods of controlling populations. The purpose of governments is not to prioritize some over others, not to punish people of other backgrounds, not to build a superior race, not to exert control over the livelihood of their people, not to treat their people as mere pawns and statistics, but to help their people in every way possible, which is what neither of these countries is currently doing and neither will do as long as they continue to prioritize the lives and well-being of some over the whole. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFoucault, Michel. \u201cSociety Must Be Defended.\u201d Lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France series.

I am hoping to learn the ethics of using generative AI in various contexts, such as creative, educational, and professional. I also want to know how to deal with credit when using generative AI as there are arguments for both sides of the issue. On one side, since the models use data from the internet, one could argue that it is using the cumulative of all these pieces of data to generate outputs. On the other hand, training on this data can be seen as being \u201cinspired by\u201d that data rather than \u201cquoting\u201d it , so credit may not be needed. \n\n\n\nMany modern-day applications are the under the disguise of being free, but take users\u2019 personal data, such as emails, phone addresses, and addresses and sell that data to companies such as data brokers, who in turn take this data and sell to other companies who could use this data for many purposes, such as email marketing or phone spam. This is an issue for many people as data that is intended for verification purposes is often times sold. Many consider it to be very immoral, but arguments for the other side exist. Since these applications are free, one could argue that the personal data is the \u201cpayment\u201d for these apps. To add onto this, users agree to terms of service, which usually highlight the app\u2019s use of personal data, meaning the burden of the data usage lies on the user. I would like to learn more about the ethics of the use of personal data because one day I would like to build an application or service that has a customer base and I would like to know how to deal with their data ethically. \n\n\n\nWhen using models, there is usually a bias in terms of what the model was trained on. This bias is then shown in the outputs of these models, which can be problematic. This is shown in AI hiring classifiers, showing biases against certain groups of people due to various biases that exist in society, etc. This is important to me because I would like to build something one day, maybe in the AI space, and I would want to rid my product of external or personal biases."}]}

We were working really well together for the first couple of weeks, but the project was interrupted by Covid in March of 2020, and caused progress to slow down and demoralize the team. I was disappointed by this because I consider myself a very goal oriented person and I always accomplish my goals, regardless of the difficulty. To overcome this problem, I took on the responsibility to become the team\u2019s scrum master and really took the initiative to lead the team and assign work. Often, team members would not follow through with deadlines in time, so I had to do a lot of convincing. I would tell them how important from a professional and resume perspective this could be once it is finished and able to be showcased, but also from an intrinsic perspective that you created a finished product that took months to build. Although I had to do more work that I originally planned on,  by the end of it, we were able to create a functioning app which I am proud of, so things worked out.\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I was always a spoilt kid as I was pretty hand-fed everything I wanted. However, once my mom started working a full time job during my junior year of HS, I had to handle a lot of responsibilities. Once I got a license, I had to start dropping and picking my younger sister from school and extracurricular activities. My other responsibilities included cooking food for us, helping and making sure she got her work done, cleaning, and others. I did struggle at first because I was not organized and punctual as a high schooler. However, I started planning out my day and becoming a lot more organized, and thus was able to deal with my responsibilities a lot more effectively. Because of these experiences, I was really able to mature and become much more focused in general.\n\n\n\nI would consider myself as very goal oriented as I always accomplish my goals, regardless of the difficulty. I apply this mindset to all facets of my life, whether it be professionally, academically, or personally. For example, I got into lifting about a year ago and set a goal the day I started lifting to be able to bench 225. Since then, I have gone to the gym consistently and have over doubled my bench and am only 5-10 pounds away from the goal. I have applied this mindset to various other parts of my life, such as hobbies, tests, and other physical goals. However, I do think I can get very obsessive about my goals at times, as I don\u2019t have dreams, but goals that I will accomplish in the near future. However, this thinking sometimes isn\u2019t healthy as I will obsess over completing my goals, causing me to be very mentally preoccupied at times. \n\n\n\nI would consider myself as very goal oriented as I always accomplish my goals, regardless of the difficulty.

I enjoy the fulfillment of completing a goal and then being able to think up of a goal even more challenging to accomplish. \n\n\n\nI was a software engineer in the Cloud Infrastructure space, where I worked on the team responsible for the company\u2019s entire pipeline. I was given a summer project to fix a certain process due to how slow and cost inefficient it was and my manager gave me a game plan on how to fix it. However, when I followed the plan and coded up a solution, it still was not fast enough and too expensive. Because of this, I had to come up with a new solution quickly because I did not have too many weeks left in the internship. After consulting with my manager and thinking about the problem more, I came up with a new solution that would be fast and cheap. However, it required me to have a more complete understanding of the existing pipeline and codebase. I do consider myself very goal oriented and really wanted to complete this project, so I maximized my productivity and focus at work and consulted with coworkers on knowledge specific to them to build the new code. Eventually, I was able to create a working product that was pushed to prod and would save the company 180K+ per year in compute costs and thousands of employee hours. \n\n\n\nI was a part of FIRST, a nonprofit organization dedicated to spreading STEM through robotics competitions. One of FIRST\u2019s key ideals is giving back to the community, so with my robotics team, I conducted a robotics summer camp for elementary students. Over two summers, we have spent hundreds of hours organizing the camp and mentoring a robotics team at the Martin Luther King Jr Center in Rock Island, Illinois, a daycare for underprivileged kids in an underrepresented town in the STEM field. After discovering the shocking statistic that almost a fifth of the students attending Rock Island High School do not graduate after four years, we wanted to combat this problem by engaging students' interest in STEM at a young age. We wanted to provide these kids from poorly funded schools and struggling families a strong first impression of STEM and a basic foundation of engineering to start their robotics season in fall. After this camp, the kids were eager to join the team when the robotics season started. We proceeded to meet several times a week in the fall to help the students create and program a functioning robot.\u00a0Throughout the season, I have been enormously impacted by their passion. For example, one student said that he loves robotics because he \u201cfeels(s) respected. People listen to what I have to say. My opinion matters. That doesn\u2019t happen at my school or at home. But it does here.''\u00a0After this experience, I have realized how fortunate I am to have the freedom to choose and pursue whatever I wish in life without being hindered by my financial or family situation.\n\n\n\nThis summer, I worked as a Cloud Infrastructure Software Engineer at John Deere where I worked on the team responsible for the company\u2019s data pipeline in AWS. I was given a project to rework the permission grant approval pipeline as the previous implementation was expensive and slow. Previously, users would have to wait hours after they requested access to data to be able to access it and unnecessary computation would drive the time and cost up as the previous implementation would iterate through every existing permission in order to grant access every four hours. I changed the pipeline from a job-based to trigger-based approval to save time and money. However, when my manager first presented me with this project, he also supplied me with a basic approach to handle the problem. This approach took me weeks to complete, but when I started testing it, I realized that the approach was not efficient enough due to an unforeseen inefficiency. Because of this, I had to create an entirely different approach in a short timespan. This required me to read through much of the pipeline\u2019s code and figure out exactly how and where I can implement a solution. After weeks of reading documentation and creating an entire pipeline, I was able to create a system ready for production, which would save the company over $180K in costs and thousands of employees hours per year. This project was so technically difficult because I have never worked in the cloud space and never on a system so big. \n\n\n\nHi, I am Darsh, and I\u2019m a junior majoring in CS at UC-Berkeley. This summer, I worked as a Cloud Infrastructure Software Engineer at John Deere where I worked on the team responsible for the company\u2019s entire data pipeline. I was given a project to improve the permission grant approval AWS pipeline as the previous implementation was expensive and slow, so I completely changed the workflow, saving the company over $180K in compute and API costs and thousands of employee hours a year. Currently, I\u2019m a Software Research Assistant, where I am currently building the data pipeline to allow real-time reading and visualization on a website of data being streamed into a Rasberry Pi. The previous summer, I worked as a Data Science Intern at Deere Financial, where I was given the project to create a long term forecast for dealer equipment inventory price and cost. I also worked as a Data Science Research Assistant last year, where I was on a project to track refugee immigration into Jordan using cellphone signals and refugee social networks. I was mainly responsible for creating data manipulation functions and basic models to supplement the research. I would consider my technical skill set very versatile as I have experience in the backend, frontend, full stack, cloud, data science, and ML fields and have enough experience learning about new technologies that I can pickup new technologies easily."}]}

He defines his socialism as equality for all people because he was inspired by the universal grace of the Amida Buddha since believing in the Amida Buddha and the Other Power allows people of any background or karmic background to reach the Pure Land. Thus, Kenmyo believes in transcendental compassion because of the Amida Buddha\u2019s salvation for all, which is why he aims to remove the inequality and discrimination in society. Overall, he wishes for paradise on Earth, one similar to the Pure Land. \n\nBoth Takagi Kenmyo and Kiyozawa Manshi were believers in Shin Buddhism and viewed the religion as a way to better society. While Kenmyo uses the endless compassion of the Amida Buddha to back his point, Manshi talks about the Two Truth doctrine to support his ideas. However, their ideals themselves were different, despite them both aiming to improve society through Shin Buddhism. Although Kenmyo believed in equality for all, Manshi believed in morality as a way to reach the Ultimate Truth. To do this, Manshi made a distinction between worldly and religious morality and worldly and absolute truth by saying morality should not be taught by religious leaders. Manshi values morality and ethics because believing in it leads to failure, which leads to reaching the Ultimate Truth. Kenmyo and Manshi are different in that Kenmyo believes in a Pure Land-like paradise on Earth, while Manshi believes in liberating as many people to the Pure Land as possible through the Ultimate Truth.\n\nI do believe that these two could have worked together well because they both are visionaries who see Shin Buddhism as a way to alleviate worldly suffering. Although they both believe in different ideas, their ideals are non-conflicting, meaning they can both follow their visions without opposing each other. Although their visions are vastly different, they would have worked well together to improve society."}]}

As a part of the monastic society, Buddhist monks have to follow the rules of the Vinaya scripture, with one of these rules saying that monks can only obtain food from the good deeds and wholesome acts of laymen. This rule connects these monks to society, which would be very beneficial to their quest on reaching enlightenment or nirvana as experiences with other people are essential to realizing the human condition.  Siddharta Gautama was able to witness first-hand the suffering or dukhka that people experience, whether it be old-age, illness, or etc, which guided him to reaching nirvana and discovering the truth or dharma. Although these monks do not contribute much labor-wise or economically to society, by following the rules of the Vinaya, a monk can \u201cfulfill their obligation to society and render himself a merit for the laity\u201d (The Buddhist Community 77). Monks can help the collective effort by being an auspicious symbol and giving blessings to laymen during significant days or important rituals, such as marriages or funerals. Also, the Vinaya scripture has these many rules regarding the lifestyle of monks because of the fact that detachment is a key necessity to reach nirvana.  This idea of detachment from human pleasures can be seen in many of the rules of the Vinaya, such as refraining from sexual misconduct and harming other living beings. For example, the begging of food is symbolic of the fact that these monks renounced their position in society for the pursuit of nirvana. By not being able to support themselves, these monks become very modest and are able to experience detachment from worldly desires, whether it be money, position in society, or delicious food. Because of the own lack of support, these monks are able to detach from reality and achieve nirvana."}]}

The signature of the UNSUB is stripping the victims and placing them in provocative poses. The UNSUB is not ashamed of their actions as they are openly showing off every victim. Another signature of the UNSUB is that they also collect trophies of their victims. Sometimes, these trophies are pictures of the victims and other times, trophies like the wedding rings might be taken off the victims before they commit anything sexual to symbolize pureness or the wedding rings might be taken off as a sexual \u201cprize\u201d. The UNSUB probably gains sexual pleasure and release from the killings. This implies that the UNSUB is most likely sexually incompetent and thus, killed and sexually assaulted the victims to feel like they have a sense of power and authority in their sex life. Most likely, the victims do not know the UNSUB at all due to the different the victims are age, location, and race wise. The UNSUB probably lives in the area of the killings and the victims probably caught the UNSUB\u2019s eye as attractive. Given their diverse, but still youngish ages, the victims probably do not remind the UNSUB of anyone particular in their lives. Rather, the UNSUB probably only chose to attack them because they were sexually attracted to the victims. The UNSUB is most likely a Power and Control type of serial killer because of the lack of agency they displayed in their sex life. The sexual incompetence of the UNSUB probably led them to attempt to achieve power and authority by taking control of their victims, sexually assaulting them, and then killing them. The UNSUB could also be a Hedonist as they took most likely pleasure in assaulting their victims, but I think that they are more likely a Power and Control type of serial killer. Based on the victims ages, I would assume that the UNSUB is a male in their twenties or thirties and saw these similarly-aged victims as sexually attractive and thus exerted himself onto them. The UNSUB is most likely white, but could be any race as they do not show a race preference in their victims. The UNSUB is most likely a lonely sociopath with little to no relationships due to their inability to achieve competence in their sex life. The UNSUB does not seem very confident in themselves and their communication ability as they could only subdue their victims phyiscally. This UNSUB reminds me of Benjamin Barnwright from the show Mindhunter. He also fits the Power and Control type and could also be classified as a sociopath. He was a white male in his twenties when he killed his girlfriend because he felt like he did not much authority in their relationship as she was promiscuous during their relationship.

For example, I have been able to find my phone number, email, address, and license plate using just my name on Google. To add to this, apps like Snapchat give out the live location of users to the friends of the user on the app, which can lead to extremely dangerous scenarios if used by the wrong people with the wrong intent.

This total control of power can be seen in the actions of governments and institutions in the nineteenth century, which Michel Foucalt mentions in the second paragraph of Society Must Be Defended. In this lecture, Foucault talks about how the power dynamic between the government and the people has shifted over time, moving from disciplinary power to one more ethical. \n\nHe quotes the phrase \u201csovereign power\u201d as the tyrannical power of governments and institutions and their control over the people\u2019s lives. Foucault says that \u201cthe right of life and death was one of sovereignty\u2019s basic attributes\u201d(240). This power and right of life, or rather, the right to kill or let live, was exercised by many in power in the 1800\u2019s and before. This so-called right can only affect people not when the sovereign chooses to let live, but only when the sovereign chooses to kill, as that is what defines the power. People have the right to choose whether or not they want to live, but only a corrupt, powerful few have the right to end your life. He goes on to say that this lopsided relationship between the people and the sovereign is \u201cparadoxical\u201d because \u201cthe subject is by rights, neither dead, nor alive...the subject is neutral\u201d(240). This contradiction is only possible because of the sovereign\u2019s ability to take life and because of this, only the sovereign can know if someone is alive or dead. This uneven relationship with the sovereign is in large part because of how the sovereign has this God-like judgement to end life, but not the ability to create it. Adding to this contradiction, sovereign power strikes fear in the hearts of the people that handed over their rights to their own lives. This connection between the sovereign and the people who are controlled by them is not an effective way of governing because first, there is no checks and balances in place to restrict the sovereign as this right of life and death is only one sided and two, this way of ruling only attempts to inflict fear and to eliminate the \u201crotten\u201d members of society rather than trying to conform the punished and strengthen the rest of the members of society.\n\nAs countries and civilizations grew and developed, this way of ruling became less and less effective due to the rapid growth and industrialization of society. So, the way of sovereign power gradually turned into quite the reverse, a phrase that Foucault has coined \u201cbiopolitics\u201d. Rather than letting live and make die, biopolitics can be seen as the opposite as it has the power to make live and let die. Rather than ruling out of fear, biopolitics is focused on managing a whole population through data such as birth rates, mortality rates, education rates, etc. This system is built on trying to improve the quality of life of the population as a whole rather than ruling with extreme fear and trying to get rid of the \u201cworst members\u201d of society. However, although they may sound very different, in practice, they do share similarities. In both cases, the ruling authority has the right over life over its constituents, although it may not seem that malicious at first. Like sovereign power, biopolitics has the ability to kill those who they please, but indirectly, as those in power can disproportionally allocate resources and things along that manner, which enables racism and separation in general, which was noted by Foucault later in the lecture. Both of these ways of governing also have God-like power, in that the authorities can choose who dies and who to save and can change the entire course of civilizations, supreme power that only rivals that of deities. \n\nOverall, Foucalt argues that the power dynamic between the constituents and the government has varied over time, starting from sovereign power and moving to biopolitics. Although government has become less focused on disciplinary measures as Foucault noted, it has not stopped them from controlling the lives and deaths of millions and billions of people. This social contract between the people and their governing is immoral and gives these governments immense power over the actions and decisions of its people. By having control over so many of these lives, these governments, as the father of the nuclear bomb, Robert Oppenehimer said, \u201chave become Death, destroyer of worlds\u201d."}]}

One of the main reasons behind this change is the removal of superstition due to the Buddhism reformation movement started by Inoue Enryo. Enryo claimed that \u201creligion teaches the way for our relative essence to enter into the absolute world. In Buddhism, this is namely enlightenment in the turning away from delusion\u201d (159). In this quote, he is saying that by ignoring delusional superstitions that existed in Buddhism back then, one can reach the \u201cabsolute\u201d, the goal of religion. These superstitions include ritual practice such as exorcising curses and belief in the supernatural such as demons, goblins and other devilish creatures. Enryo leads the change from ritual-based Buddhism to a more modern and idealistic form of the religion, one based more on philosophy than practice. Inoue Enryo also uses the concept of shojo nimon, the idea of means of awakening, whether it be achieving nirvana or reaching the Pure Land by reciting nembutsu. Enryo argues that the ritual nature of nembutsu is based on the philosophical values of Mahayana Buddhism and exists to appeal to people who do not yearn for spiritual ideals, and thus works the same to reach enlightenment. This use of shojo nimon by Enryo is used to show that Buddhsim is shifting to religion based more on belief because people partake in both of these rituals because they believe that they can detach from this material world and become enlightened. The acceptance of clerical marriage by the S\u014dt\u014d school also shows the shift of Japanese Buddhism from practice to belief. This major adoption was backed by the idea that anyone should be able to reach enlightenment, whether they are married or not. Because of this ideal, this practice of clergy not marrying diminished in popularity because enlightenment is based on one\u2019s beliefs, spirituality, and connection to this world, not whether or not they are married. In conclusion, Inoue Enryo\u2019s concept of shojo nimon, Enryo\u2019s definition of religion, and the acceptance of clerical marriage led to a shift from practice to belief in Japanese Buddhism."}]}

According to Du Bois, the color line describes the economic and social gap between white people and African Americans and minorities in general in the US. Du Bois claims that emancipation has not completely freed African Americans, as they are still trapped into poverty due to the white upper class exploiting them for cheap labor. Even though African Americans were free, they were not equal to white Americans economically, socially, politically, nor educationally. Du Bois blames this problem on the nature of capitalism and exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie. He claims that \u201cthe workers of the world must have voice not only on conditions of work but also as to what kinds of good shall be produced and what methods of production used\u201d (The World and Africa 161). This is an expansion of Marx\u2019s ideals because he also claims that the bourgeoisie exploit the proletariat (in this case, the upper class of white Americans exploiting African Americans) and that the workers should have a voice in the means of production. This is an update to Marxist belief because Marx believed that the workers should seize control of the means of production and implement communism, which Du Bois has not explicitly stated. Du Bois believed that African Americans had a lack of opportunity in the US because they had no wealth to begin with once they were emancipated and white employers still were very racist long after emancipation. Du Bois also claimed that there was a lack of opportunity for the knowledgeable and literate African Americans because literacy only correlated negatively with violent crimes, meaning literate people had to commit petty crime to survive, since there were not many employment opportunities for them. This fits into Marxist theory because these crimes committed are a result of the below subsistence pay from white exploitation or no pay at all due to lack of opportunities. Overall, the Du Bois analysis of the color line leads to the possibility of a Marxist revolution by the underrepresented and underserved minorities to potentially seize the means of production and be on an equal footing as the majority oppressors. \n\n\n\nQuestion 2:\n\n\n\nDurkheim and Weber had different, but similar perspectives on the function of law in society. Durkheim thought that the laws of society exist to protect the consciousness of the entire society. Durkheim believed that crimes were illegal because they \u201cseem harmful to the society that represses them\u201d (Division of Labor 73) rather than actually being harmful to society. Thus, Durkheim believed that punishment is a way of striking fear into people so they don\u2019t plan on hurting society by committing the crime. Durkheims\u2019s ideals are based on the fact that society has a collective consciousness, and thus all share some values and morals. This type of thought process works in a mechanical society, meaning that societies are independent and do not need to interact with each other to survive and thrive. Since people are closer to each other in a mechanical society, there is a much larger collective consciousness, compared to an organic society, which is a society that depends on other societies to survive, meaning that their work is more specialized. There is a much less effect of the collective conscience in this type of society, and thus there is more individualism. There are more interactions between different types of people in an organic society, and thus, \u201cat the same time that domestic obligations become more numerous, they take on, as is said, a public character\u201d (210). In this society, relationships become under the control of the law, which is different compared to mechanical societies. \n\n\n\nWeber believed that the law should act very rationally, in that it equally applies to everyone in society, with no exceptions. He believed in rationality because it allows society to be more efficient and predictable because situations do not have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but rather, everything works under one rational system. Weber believed that law systems and institutions should be structured as bureaucracies, in which public servants exist to rationally handle the day-to-day matters of the people and work under the voted-in government officials. Weber believed in a formally rational system of law, in which values are treated as distinct to the law, in which laws are based on those set values. \n\nOverall, Weber believes that the law should be based on a set of values, but Weber has a more rational approach to this problem.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3:\n\n\n\n\tMarx and Maine have different thoughts on rights. Marx claims that natural rights are a creation of the bourgeois and belief in them benefits the upper class. He does not believe that legal rights are a pathway to achieving freedom. Marx talks about the political and civil sphere, in that it is possible to achieve freedom in the political sphere with laws that promote voting rights, etc, but it is impossible to achieve freedom in the civil sphere, as it is impossible to stop ideas such as racism from being spread in people\u2019s minds. Political freedom benefits the bourgeois because it gives the illusion of full freedom, when people are actually bound by the limitations of the civil sphere. This allows the bourgeois to take away the proletariat's rights, thus benefiting them greatly. \n\n\n\n\tMaine believes that over time, society has shifted from status-based to contract-based. Thus, he believes that rights shifted from being based on the status of the individual to the contracts of the individual. Maine believes that rights are earned, which contrasts Marx\u2019s perspective of natural rights. They also differ because Marx doesn\u2019t believe that people can achieve true freedom with rights, while Maine believes that people can, they just need to earn it based on their contracts. Overall, Marx and Maine have wildly different views on the topic of rights and their function within the state."}]}

In the article US Says China\u2019s Repression of Uighurs is Genocide, the authors say that former president Trump declares that the atrocities happening to Uighur Muslims in China right now are genocide after \u201cbrushing away the concerns\u201d for years. Since 2014, China has taken part in the Uighur genocide of millions of Uighur Muslims across the country through the use of internment camps, torture, forced sterilization, and many human rights violations. Almost seven years later, the US has become the first country in the entire world to acknowledge this tragedy as a genocide, as defined by the United Nations, is \u201cacts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\u201d, which is very shocking considering the advancement in human rights since the Holocaust. More than 50 years after World War 2, it seems as if history has repeated itself through these genocides, despite the supposed efforts by many countries including the US to prevent this. It is laughable that the so-called greatest countries of the world have just started to acknowledge this devastating genocide. How can countries built on the principles of freedom and democracy refuse to take action when millions of innocent civilians have had their rights stripped from them and are being treated like farm animals? Weeks after the acknowledgment of the genocide, President Biden commented that these atrocities were just a different cultural norm, doubling down on the worldwide efforts to refuse to get involved in China\u2019s blatant violation of human rights. Although many think of America as a free and democratic utopia, based on the government\u2019s lack of action during the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of action dealing with the Uighur genocide, the US is a lot more similar to the oppressive nature of China than many people may think. \n\nThe sovereign authoritarian government of China is described in Foucault\u2019s lecture Society Must Be Defended, in which he says that the sovereign has the right of life and death in that they could \u201ctake life and let live\u201d (8), which can be seen through the government\u2019s efforts in the Uighur genocide. Although Foucault is talking about governments of centuries past, it can be applied to modern-day regimes like China, a country is known for its corrupt and authoritarian government that heavily censors and violates its constituents. By putting these Uighur Muslims in internment camps and stripping them of their humanity, the Chinese government is exercising its sovereign power over their people. They have the \u201cright of the sword\u201d over these interned Uighurs and their people in general in that they have the disproportionate ability to take life away rather than to create life. This function of this supposed right is to improve the well-being of society, and yet, these efforts are very counterproductive, as these internment camps are used for re-education, brainwashing, and mass sterilization to prevent and eliminate the spread of Uighur culture to mainland China. Control of this nature and magnitude over a population has been seen before in history, as pointed out by Foucault: \u201cThere was, in Nazism, a coincidence, between a generalized biopower and a dictatorship that was at once absolute and retransmitted throughout this entire social body by this fantastic extension of the right to kill and the exposure of death\u201d (27). Modern-day countries such as the US can control and manipulate the biological whole of society, but China and Nazi Germany both exert this biopower over their population and sovereign power over their individual constituents. Both of these regimes have God-like control over their populations due to their right of life over the population\u2019s birth rates and the right of death with their ability to take lives. This divine power should not be given to any governing body, especially not to an inhumane, authoritarian, and oppressive government like China. The Nazi state\u2019s use of extreme racism to attempt to better society through the elimination of races and cultures that they deemed inferior ultimately backfired as this genocide caused the destruction and fall of their people and regime. The Uighur genocide can be seen as propaganda used to brainwash the Chinese people that their race, culture, and lifestyle are superior to others and that inferior cultures should be wiped out and replaced. This cruel sovereign power of the Chinese government should not exist as they have too much power in controlling the lives of their constituents.\n\n\tAlthough countries like the US are always put on this pedestal because of the opportunities, democracy, and freedom, they are not that different from authoritarian regimes such as China. Foucault mentions in his lecture Society Must Be Defended that modern governments moved from using sovereign power to using biopower and biopolitics to influence and control their population. He continues by saying that biopolitics is controlling society as a whole through the control of life metrics such as birth rate, life expectancy, mortality rate, and more. While China has a big influence on how individuals act due to their sovereign power, the US has this same influence, but across the general population. This biopower can be seen through the events that took place this year in the Coronavirus. Since the virus spread to America last March, there have been over half a million deaths in the US alone, many of which can be attributed to the government\u2019s lack of response. The biopolitics of the US was incapable of helping the American people during this time of great need due to the disinformation and lack of action by the government. Foucault coins the biopower\u2019s right over life and death \u201cmake live or let die\u201d, differing from the sovereign's ability to \u201clet live or make die\u201d, to describe how biopolitics functions, which can be seen in consequences of the American government\u2019s efforts today. Due to the little action and disinformation, the government has let thousands of Americans die every day, disproportionately affecting the elderly, poor, and minority communities. This inequality can also be seen through the current vaccine distribution in America as these same communities that are most affected by the virus are getting unequally less access to the vaccines compared to more privileged and wealthier people. Foucault speaks on the racism depicted here, saying \u201cIt is primarily a way of introducing a break into the domain of life that is under power\u2019s control; the break between what must live and what must die\u201d (21). Because of the country\u2019s biopolitical system, the US has used segregation and prejudice, in general, to pick and choose who to make survive and who to let die based on age, race, income, etc. A country considered to be the paradise for immigrants around the world is stained with all types of racism and bigotry against those same foreigners, which is apparent in the many recent events of racial hatred. The US recognizing the Uighur tragedy as genocide is ironic as they have established the norm of thousands of innocent Americans dying every day because of the government\u2019s inabilities and choices. \n\nBefore the pandemic, we were able to implicitly use the air without having to worry about masks, large crowds, etc, but now we live in a time where that implicit has become explicit. The atmo-terrorism that Sloterdjik talks about in Terror from the Air is very similar to the Coronavirus because \u201cthe necessity to breathe, becomes at once a victim and an unwilling accomplice in his own annihilation\u201d (Sloterdijk 20-21). This connects to current day events because of how we took for granted breathable air now that the air has become miasma and infected due to the virus. However, due to the partisan disinformation spread during the last year, people have ignored the toxic explicit environment and lived their lives like usual, leading to so many American casualties. America has said that they will take action against China\u2019s genocide of Uighur Muslims, but how can a country that has caused the deaths of over half a million of its people tell another country how to treat its constituents? There will likely be zero action taken by the US government to stop the Uighur genocide because an oppressive regime is in no power and has no reason to tell another oppressive regime what to do. These countries are so similar because both the biopolitics of the US and the sovereign power of China are immoral methods of controlling populations. The purpose of governments is not to prioritize some over others, not to punish people of other backgrounds, not to build a superior race, not to exert control over the livelihood of their people, not to treat their people as mere pawns and statistics, but to help their people in every way possible, which is what neither of these countries is currently doing and neither will do as long as they continue to prioritize the lives and well-being of some over the whole. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFoucault, Michel. \u201cSociety Must Be Defended.\u201d Lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France series.

The prevelance of Large Language Models and Generative Adversial Networks has given rise to several AI text and image generation methods. Since these models are trained on enormous amounts of data, mainly scraped from the internet, questions of the ethics of use and credit arise when using generative AI. As an avid user of GPT models for a variety of reasons, I also question when or when not I should use this technology to my advantage. I am hoping to learn the ethics of using generative AI in various contexts, such as creative, educational, and professional. I also want to know how to deal with credit when using generative AI as there are arguments for both sides of the issue. On one side, since the models use data from the internet, one could argue that it is using the cumulative of all these pieces of data to generate outputs. On the other hand, training on this data can be seen as being \u201cinspired by\u201d that data rather than \u201cquoting\u201d it , so credit may not be needed. \n\n\n\nMany modern-day applications are the under the disguise of being free, but take users\u2019 personal data, such as emails, phone addresses, and addresses and sell that data to companies such as data brokers, who in turn take this data and sell to other companies who could use this data for many purposes, such as email marketing or phone spam. This is an issue for many people as data that is intended for verification purposes is often times sold. Many consider it to be very immoral, but arguments for the other side exist. Since these applications are free, one could argue that the personal data is the \u201cpayment\u201d for these apps. To add onto this, users agree to terms of service, which usually highlight the app\u2019s use of personal data, meaning the burden of the data usage lies on the user. I would like to learn more about the ethics of the use of personal data because one day I would like to build an application or service that has a customer base and I would like to know how to deal with their data ethically. \n\n\n\nWhen using models, there is usually a bias in terms of what the model was trained on. This bias is then shown in the outputs of these models, which can be problematic. This is shown in AI hiring classifiers, showing biases against certain groups of people due to various biases that exist in society, etc. This is important to me because I would like to build something one day, maybe in the AI space, and I would want to rid my product of external or personal biases."}]}

We were working really well together for the first couple of weeks, but the project was interrupted by Covid in March of 2020, and caused progress to slow down and demoralize the team. I was disappointed by this because I consider myself a very goal oriented person and I always accomplish my goals, regardless of the difficulty. To overcome this problem, I took on the responsibility to become the team\u2019s scrum master and really took the initiative to lead the team and assign work. Often, team members would not follow through with deadlines in time, so I had to do a lot of convincing. I would tell them how important from a professional and resume perspective this could be once it is finished and able to be showcased, but also from an intrinsic perspective that you created a finished product that took months to build. Although I had to do more work that I originally planned on,  by the end of it, we were able to create a functioning app which I am proud of, so things worked out.\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I was always a spoilt kid as I was pretty hand-fed everything I wanted. However, once my mom started working a full time job during my junior year of HS, I had to handle a lot of responsibilities. Once I got a license, I had to start dropping and picking my younger sister from school and extracurricular activities. My other responsibilities included cooking food for us, helping and making sure she got her work done, cleaning, and others. I did struggle at first because I was not organized and punctual as a high schooler. However, I started planning out my day and becoming a lot more organized, and thus was able to deal with my responsibilities a lot more effectively. Because of these experiences, I was really able to mature and become much more focused in general.\n\n\n\nI would consider myself as very goal oriented as I always accomplish my goals, regardless of the difficulty. I apply this mindset to all facets of my life, whether it be professionally, academically, or personally. For example, I got into lifting about a year ago and set a goal the day I started lifting to be able to bench 225. Since then, I have gone to the gym consistently and have over doubled my bench and am only 5-10 pounds away from the goal. I have applied this mindset to various other parts of my life, such as hobbies, tests, and other physical goals. However, I do think I can get very obsessive about my goals at times, as I don\u2019t have dreams, but goals that I will accomplish in the near future. However, this thinking sometimes isn\u2019t healthy as I will obsess over completing my goals, causing me to be very mentally preoccupied at times. \n\n\n\nI would consider myself as very goal oriented as I always accomplish my goals, regardless of the difficulty.

I enjoy the fulfillment of completing a goal and then being able to think up of a goal even more challenging to accomplish. \n\n\n\nI was a software engineer in the Cloud Infrastructure space, where I worked on the team responsible for the company\u2019s entire pipeline. I was given a summer project to fix a certain process due to how slow and cost inefficient it was and my manager gave me a game plan on how to fix it. However, when I followed the plan and coded up a solution, it still was not fast enough and too expensive. Because of this, I had to come up with a new solution quickly because I did not have too many weeks left in the internship. After consulting with my manager and thinking about the problem more, I came up with a new solution that would be fast and cheap. However, it required me to have a more complete understanding of the existing pipeline and codebase. I do consider myself very goal oriented and really wanted to complete this project, so I maximized my productivity and focus at work and consulted with coworkers on knowledge specific to them to build the new code. Eventually, I was able to create a working product that was pushed to prod and would save the company 180K+ per year in compute costs and thousands of employee hours. \n\n\n\nI was a part of FIRST, a nonprofit organization dedicated to spreading STEM through robotics competitions. One of FIRST\u2019s key ideals is giving back to the community, so with my robotics team, I conducted a robotics summer camp for elementary students. Over two summers, we have spent hundreds of hours organizing the camp and mentoring a robotics team at the Martin Luther King Jr Center in Rock Island, Illinois, a daycare for underprivileged kids in an underrepresented town in the STEM field. After discovering the shocking statistic that almost a fifth of the students attending Rock Island High School do not graduate after four years, we wanted to combat this problem by engaging students' interest in STEM at a young age. We wanted to provide these kids from poorly funded schools and struggling families a strong first impression of STEM and a basic foundation of engineering to start their robotics season in fall. After this camp, the kids were eager to join the team when the robotics season started. We proceeded to meet several times a week in the fall to help the students create and program a functioning robot.\u00a0Throughout the season, I have been enormously impacted by their passion. For example, one student said that he loves robotics because he \u201cfeels(s) respected. People listen to what I have to say. My opinion matters. That doesn\u2019t happen at my school or at home. But it does here.''\u00a0After this experience, I have realized how fortunate I am to have the freedom to choose and pursue whatever I wish in life without being hindered by my financial or family situation.\n\n\n\nThis summer, I worked as a Cloud Infrastructure Software Engineer at John Deere where I worked on the team responsible for the company\u2019s data pipeline in AWS. I was given a project to rework the permission grant approval pipeline as the previous implementation was expensive and slow. Previously, users would have to wait hours after they requested access to data to be able to access it and unnecessary computation would drive the time and cost up as the previous implementation would iterate through every existing permission in order to grant access every four hours. I changed the pipeline from a job-based to trigger-based approval to save time and money. However, when my manager first presented me with this project, he also supplied me with a basic approach to handle the problem. This approach took me weeks to complete, but when I started testing it, I realized that the approach was not efficient enough due to an unforeseen inefficiency. Because of this, I had to create an entirely different approach in a short timespan. This required me to read through much of the pipeline\u2019s code and figure out exactly how and where I can implement a solution. After weeks of reading documentation and creating an entire pipeline, I was able to create a system ready for production, which would save the company over $180K in costs and thousands of employees hours per year. This project was so technically difficult because I have never worked in the cloud space and never on a system so big. \n\n\n\nHi, I am Darsh, and I\u2019m a junior majoring in CS at UC-Berkeley. This summer, I worked as a Cloud Infrastructure Software Engineer at John Deere where I worked on the team responsible for the company\u2019s entire data pipeline. I was given a project to improve the permission grant approval AWS pipeline as the previous implementation was expensive and slow, so I completely changed the workflow, saving the company over $180K in compute and API costs and thousands of employee hours a year. Currently, I\u2019m a Software Research Assistant, where I am currently building the data pipeline to allow real-time reading and visualization on a website of data being streamed into a Rasberry Pi. The previous summer, I worked as a Data Science Intern at Deere Financial, where I was given the project to create a long term forecast for dealer equipment inventory price and cost. I also worked as a Data Science Research Assistant last year, where I was on a project to track refugee immigration into Jordan using cellphone signals and refugee social networks. I was mainly responsible for creating data manipulation functions and basic models to supplement the research. I would consider my technical skill set very versatile as I have experience in the backend, frontend, full stack, cloud, data science, and ML fields and have enough experience learning about new technologies that I can pickup new technologies easily."}]}

However, their ideals themselves were different, despite them both aiming to improve society through Shin Buddhism. Although Kenmyo believed in equality for all, Manshi believed in morality as a way to reach the Ultimate Truth. To do this, Manshi made a distinction between worldly and religious morality and worldly and absolute truth by saying morality should not be taught by religious leaders. Manshi values morality and ethics because believing in it leads to failure, which leads to reaching the Ultimate Truth. Kenmyo and Manshi are different in that Kenmyo believes in a Pure Land-like paradise on Earth, while Manshi believes in liberating as many people to the Pure Land as possible through the Ultimate Truth.\n\nI do believe that these two could have worked together well because they both are visionaries who see Shin Buddhism as a way to alleviate worldly suffering.
