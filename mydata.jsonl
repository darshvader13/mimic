As a part of the monastic society, Buddhist monks have to follow the rules of the Vinaya scripture, with one of these rules saying that monks can only obtain food from the good deeds and wholesome acts of laymen. This rule connects these monks to society, which would be very beneficial to their quest on reaching enlightenment or nirvana as experiences with other people are essential to realizing the human condition.  Siddharta Gautama was able to witness first-hand the suffering or dukhka that people experience, whether it be old-age, illness, or etc, which guided him to reaching nirvana and discovering the truth or dharma. Although these monks do not contribute much labor-wise or economically to society, by following the rules of the Vinaya, a monk can \u201cfulfill their obligation to society and render himself a merit for the laity\u201d (The Buddhist Community 77). Monks can help the collective effort by being an auspicious symbol and giving blessings to laymen during significant days or important rituals, such as marriages or funerals. Also, the Vinaya scripture has these many rules regarding the lifestyle of monks because of the fact that detachment is a key necessity to reach nirvana.  This idea of detachment from human pleasures can be seen in many of the rules of the Vinaya, such as refraining from sexual misconduct and harming other living beings. For example, the begging of food is symbolic of the fact that these monks renounced their position in society for the pursuit of nirvana. By not being able to support themselves, these monks become very modest and are able to experience detachment from worldly desires, whether it be money, position in society, or delicious food. Because of the own lack of support, these monks are able to detach from reality and achieve nirvana."}]}

This total control of power can be seen in the actions of governments and institutions in the nineteenth century, which Michel Foucalt mentions in the second paragraph of Society Must Be Defended. In this lecture, Foucault talks about how the power dynamic between the government and the people has shifted over time, moving from disciplinary power to one more ethical. \n\nHe quotes the phrase \u201csovereign power\u201d as the tyrannical power of governments and institutions and their control over the people\u2019s lives. Foucault says that \u201cthe right of life and death was one of sovereignty\u2019s basic attributes\u201d(240). This power and right of life, or rather, the right to kill or let live, was exercised by many in power in the 1800\u2019s and before. This so-called right can only affect people not when the sovereign chooses to let live, but only when the sovereign chooses to kill, as that is what defines the power. People have the right to choose whether or not they want to live, but only a corrupt, powerful few have the right to end your life. He goes on to say that this lopsided relationship between the people and the sovereign is \u201cparadoxical\u201d because \u201cthe subject is by rights, neither dead, nor alive...the subject is neutral\u201d(240). This contradiction is only possible because of the sovereign\u2019s ability to take life and because of this, only the sovereign can know if someone is alive or dead. This uneven relationship with the sovereign is in large part because of how the sovereign has this God-like judgement to end life, but not the ability to create it. Adding to this contradiction, sovereign power strikes fear in the hearts of the people that handed over their rights to their own lives. This connection between the sovereign and the people who are controlled by them is not an effective way of governing because first, there is no checks and balances in place to restrict the sovereign as this right of life and death is only one sided and two, this way of ruling only attempts to inflict fear and to eliminate the \u201crotten\u201d members of society rather than trying to conform the punished and strengthen the rest of the members of society.\n\nAs countries and civilizations grew and developed, this way of ruling became less and less effective due to the rapid growth and industrialization of society. So, the way of sovereign power gradually turned into quite the reverse, a phrase that Foucault has coined \u201cbiopolitics\u201d. Rather than letting live and make die, biopolitics can be seen as the opposite as it has the power to make live and let die. Rather than ruling out of fear, biopolitics is focused on managing a whole population through data such as birth rates, mortality rates, education rates, etc. This system is built on trying to improve the quality of life of the population as a whole rather than ruling with extreme fear and trying to get rid of the \u201cworst members\u201d of society. However, although they may sound very different, in practice, they do share similarities. In both cases, the ruling authority has the right over life over its constituents, although it may not seem that malicious at first. Like sovereign power, biopolitics has the ability to kill those who they please, but indirectly, as those in power can disproportionally allocate resources and things along that manner, which enables racism and separation in general, which was noted by Foucault later in the lecture. Both of these ways of governing also have God-like power, in that the authorities can choose who dies and who to save and can change the entire course of civilizations, supreme power that only rivals that of deities. \n\nOverall, Foucalt argues that the power dynamic between the constituents and the government has varied over time, starting from sovereign power and moving to biopolitics. Although government has become less focused on disciplinary measures as Foucault noted, it has not stopped them from controlling the lives and deaths of millions and billions of people. This social contract between the people and their governing is immoral and gives these governments immense power over the actions and decisions of its people. By having control over so many of these lives, these governments, as the father of the nuclear bomb, Robert Oppenehimer said, \u201chave become Death, destroyer of worlds\u201d."}]}

According to Du Bois, the color line describes the economic and social gap between white people and African Americans and minorities in general in the US. Du Bois claims that emancipation has not completely freed African Americans, as they are still trapped into poverty due to the white upper class exploiting them for cheap labor. Even though African Americans were free, they were not equal to white Americans economically, socially, politically, nor educationally. Du Bois blames this problem on the nature of capitalism and exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie. He claims that \u201cthe workers of the world must have voice not only on conditions of work but also as to what kinds of good shall be produced and what methods of production used\u201d (The World and Africa 161). This is an expansion of Marx\u2019s ideals because he also claims that the bourgeoisie exploit the proletariat (in this case, the upper class of white Americans exploiting African Americans) and that the workers should have a voice in the means of production. This is an update to Marxist belief because Marx believed that the workers should seize control of the means of production and implement communism, which Du Bois has not explicitly stated. Du Bois believed that African Americans had a lack of opportunity in the US because they had no wealth to begin with once they were emancipated and white employers still were very racist long after emancipation. Du Bois also claimed that there was a lack of opportunity for the knowledgeable and literate African Americans because literacy only correlated negatively with violent crimes, meaning literate people had to commit petty crime to survive, since there were not many employment opportunities for them. This fits into Marxist theory because these crimes committed are a result of the below subsistence pay from white exploitation or no pay at all due to lack of opportunities. Overall, the Du Bois analysis of the color line leads to the possibility of a Marxist revolution by the underrepresented and underserved minorities to potentially seize the means of production and be on an equal footing as the majority oppressors. \n\n\n\nQuestion 2:\n\n\n\nDurkheim and Weber had different, but similar perspectives on the function of law in society. Durkheim thought that the laws of society exist to protect the consciousness of the entire society. Durkheim believed that crimes were illegal because they \u201cseem harmful to the society that represses them\u201d (Division of Labor 73) rather than actually being harmful to society. Thus, Durkheim believed that punishment is a way of striking fear into people so they don\u2019t plan on hurting society by committing the crime. Durkheims\u2019s ideals are based on the fact that society has a collective consciousness, and thus all share some values and morals. This type of thought process works in a mechanical society, meaning that societies are independent and do not need to interact with each other to survive and thrive. Since people are closer to each other in a mechanical society, there is a much larger collective consciousness, compared to an organic society, which is a society that depends on other societies to survive, meaning that their work is more specialized. There is a much less effect of the collective conscience in this type of society, and thus there is more individualism. There are more interactions between different types of people in an organic society, and thus, \u201cat the same time that domestic obligations become more numerous, they take on, as is said, a public character\u201d (210). In this society, relationships become under the control of the law, which is different compared to mechanical societies. \n\n\n\nWeber believed that the law should act very rationally, in that it equally applies to everyone in society, with no exceptions. He believed in rationality because it allows society to be more efficient and predictable because situations do not have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but rather, everything works under one rational system. Weber believed that law systems and institutions should be structured as bureaucracies, in which public servants exist to rationally handle the day-to-day matters of the people and work under the voted-in government officials. Weber believed in a formally rational system of law, in which values are treated as distinct to the law, in which laws are based on those set values. \n\nOverall, Weber believes that the law should be based on a set of values, but Weber has a more rational approach to this problem.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3:\n\n\n\n\tMarx and Maine have different thoughts on rights. Marx claims that natural rights are a creation of the bourgeois and belief in them benefits the upper class. He does not believe that legal rights are a pathway to achieving freedom. Marx talks about the political and civil sphere, in that it is possible to achieve freedom in the political sphere with laws that promote voting rights, etc, but it is impossible to achieve freedom in the civil sphere, as it is impossible to stop ideas such as racism from being spread in people\u2019s minds. Political freedom benefits the bourgeois because it gives the illusion of full freedom, when people are actually bound by the limitations of the civil sphere. This allows the bourgeois to take away the proletariat's rights, thus benefiting them greatly. \n\n\n\n\tMaine believes that over time, society has shifted from status-based to contract-based. Thus, he believes that rights shifted from being based on the status of the individual to the contracts of the individual. Maine believes that rights are earned, which contrasts Marx\u2019s perspective of natural rights. They also differ because Marx doesn\u2019t believe that people can achieve true freedom with rights, while Maine believes that people can, they just need to earn it based on their contracts. Overall, Marx and Maine have wildly different views on the topic of rights and their function within the state."}]}

We were working really well together for the first couple of weeks, but the project was interrupted by Covid in March of 2020, and caused progress to slow down and demoralize the team. I was disappointed by this because I consider myself a very goal oriented person and I always accomplish my goals, regardless of the difficulty. To overcome this problem, I took on the responsibility to become the team\u2019s scrum master and really took the initiative to lead the team and assign work. Often, team members would not follow through with deadlines in time, so I had to do a lot of convincing. I would tell them how important from a professional and resume perspective this could be once it is finished and able to be showcased, but also from an intrinsic perspective that you created a finished product that took months to build. Although I had to do more work that I originally planned on,  by the end of it, we were able to create a functioning app which I am proud of, so things worked out.\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I was always a spoilt kid as I was pretty hand-fed everything I wanted. However, once my mom started working a full time job during my junior year of HS, I had to handle a lot of responsibilities. Once I got a license, I had to start dropping and picking my younger sister from school and extracurricular activities. My other responsibilities included cooking food for us, helping and making sure she got her work done, cleaning, and others. I did struggle at first because I was not organized and punctual as a high schooler. However, I started planning out my day and becoming a lot more organized, and thus was able to deal with my responsibilities a lot more effectively. Because of these experiences, I was really able to mature and become much more focused in general.\n\n\n\nI would consider myself as very goal oriented as I always accomplish my goals, regardless of the difficulty. I apply this mindset to all facets of my life, whether it be professionally, academically, or personally. For example, I got into lifting about a year ago and set a goal the day I started lifting to be able to bench 225. Since then, I have gone to the gym consistently and have over doubled my bench and am only 5-10 pounds away from the goal. I have applied this mindset to various other parts of my life, such as hobbies, tests, and other physical goals. However, I do think I can get very obsessive about my goals at times, as I don\u2019t have dreams, but goals that I will accomplish in the near future. However, this thinking sometimes isn\u2019t healthy as I will obsess over completing my goals, causing me to be very mentally preoccupied at times. \n\n\n\nI would consider myself as very goal oriented as I always accomplish my goals, regardless of the difficulty.

I enjoy the fulfillment of completing a goal and then being able to think up of a goal even more challenging to accomplish. \n\n\n\nI was a software engineer in the Cloud Infrastructure space, where I worked on the team responsible for the company\u2019s entire pipeline. I was given a summer project to fix a certain process due to how slow and cost inefficient it was and my manager gave me a game plan on how to fix it. However, when I followed the plan and coded up a solution, it still was not fast enough and too expensive. Because of this, I had to come up with a new solution quickly because I did not have too many weeks left in the internship. After consulting with my manager and thinking about the problem more, I came up with a new solution that would be fast and cheap. However, it required me to have a more complete understanding of the existing pipeline and codebase. I do consider myself very goal oriented and really wanted to complete this project, so I maximized my productivity and focus at work and consulted with coworkers on knowledge specific to them to build the new code. Eventually, I was able to create a working product that was pushed to prod and would save the company 180K+ per year in compute costs and thousands of employee hours. \n\n\n\nI was a part of FIRST, a nonprofit organization dedicated to spreading STEM through robotics competitions. One of FIRST\u2019s key ideals is giving back to the community, so with my robotics team, I conducted a robotics summer camp for elementary students. Over two summers, we have spent hundreds of hours organizing the camp and mentoring a robotics team at the Martin Luther King Jr Center in Rock Island, Illinois, a daycare for underprivileged kids in an underrepresented town in the STEM field. After discovering the shocking statistic that almost a fifth of the students attending Rock Island High School do not graduate after four years, we wanted to combat this problem by engaging students' interest in STEM at a young age. We wanted to provide these kids from poorly funded schools and struggling families a strong first impression of STEM and a basic foundation of engineering to start their robotics season in fall. After this camp, the kids were eager to join the team when the robotics season started. We proceeded to meet several times a week in the fall to help the students create and program a functioning robot.\u00a0Throughout the season, I have been enormously impacted by their passion. For example, one student said that he loves robotics because he \u201cfeels(s) respected. People listen to what I have to say. My opinion matters. That doesn\u2019t happen at my school or at home. But it does here.''\u00a0After this experience, I have realized how fortunate I am to have the freedom to choose and pursue whatever I wish in life without being hindered by my financial or family situation.\n\n\n\nThis summer, I worked as a Cloud Infrastructure Software Engineer at John Deere where I worked on the team responsible for the company\u2019s data pipeline in AWS. I was given a project to rework the permission grant approval pipeline as the previous implementation was expensive and slow. Previously, users would have to wait hours after they requested access to data to be able to access it and unnecessary computation would drive the time and cost up as the previous implementation would iterate through every existing permission in order to grant access every four hours. I changed the pipeline from a job-based to trigger-based approval to save time and money. However, when my manager first presented me with this project, he also supplied me with a basic approach to handle the problem. This approach took me weeks to complete, but when I started testing it, I realized that the approach was not efficient enough due to an unforeseen inefficiency. Because of this, I had to create an entirely different approach in a short timespan. This required me to read through much of the pipeline\u2019s code and figure out exactly how and where I can implement a solution. After weeks of reading documentation and creating an entire pipeline, I was able to create a system ready for production, which would save the company over $180K in costs and thousands of employees hours per year. This project was so technically difficult because I have never worked in the cloud space and never on a system so big. \n\n\n\nHi, I am Darsh, and I\u2019m a junior majoring in CS at UC-Berkeley. This summer, I worked as a Cloud Infrastructure Software Engineer at John Deere where I worked on the team responsible for the company\u2019s entire data pipeline. I was given a project to improve the permission grant approval AWS pipeline as the previous implementation was expensive and slow, so I completely changed the workflow, saving the company over $180K in compute and API costs and thousands of employee hours a year. Currently, I\u2019m a Software Research Assistant, where I am currently building the data pipeline to allow real-time reading and visualization on a website of data being streamed into a Rasberry Pi. The previous summer, I worked as a Data Science Intern at Deere Financial, where I was given the project to create a long term forecast for dealer equipment inventory price and cost. I also worked as a Data Science Research Assistant last year, where I was on a project to track refugee immigration into Jordan using cellphone signals and refugee social networks. I was mainly responsible for creating data manipulation functions and basic models to supplement the research. I would consider my technical skill set very versatile as I have experience in the backend, frontend, full stack, cloud, data science, and ML fields and have enough experience learning about new technologies that I can pickup new technologies easily."}]}
